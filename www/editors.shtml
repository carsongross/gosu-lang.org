	   <h1>IntelliJ</h1>

		  <h2>Installing The Gosu Plugin - The BEST option</h2>
		
		   <div>The Gosu Plugin for IntelliJ works with IntelliJ 11.x, which can be downloaded <b>for free</b> from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">here</a></div>
			<br/>
			 <div>Once IntelliJ has been downloaded and installed, the Gosu Plugin can be installed by the following steps:
				   <ul>
					   <li>Open IntelliJ</li>
					   <li>On Windows and Linux press Control-Alt-S to bring up the Settings Dialog</li>
					   <li>On Mac press Cmd-, to bring up the Settings Dialog</li>
					   <li>Select the 'Plugins' entry</li>
					   <li>Click the 'Browse repositories...' button</li>
					   <li>Search for 'Gosu' in the search box</li>
					   <li>Right click on the Gosu plugin and select 'Install'</li>
					   <li>Restart IntelliJ</li>
					 </ul>
			  <div>
				  Once the plugin has been installed, you can create a new Java project.  Once the project has been created and opened, select the 'Default Gosu SDK' for the project by the following steps:
				  <ul>
					   <li>On Windows and Linux press Control-Alt-ShiftS to bring up the Settings Dialog</li>
					   <li>On Mac press Cmd-; to bring up the Settings Dialog</li>
					   <li>Select 'Project' and in the Project SDK dropdown, select 'Default Gosu SDK'</li>
					</ul>
					You should now be good to go!
				</div>

			  <h1>Built-in Gosu Editor</h1>
			  <div>This is the primary editor that we recommend you start with.  If you invoke gosu.sh or gosu.cmd, you will see the built-in editor.  If you follow the <a href="http://metapete.blogspot.com/2011/05/setting-up-gosu-project.html"> instructions for how to setup a project structure</a> and get your classpath setup, it will work well and provide intellisense, as well as some really useful keyboard shortcuts</div>
			  <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
			  <ul>
			    <li> Ctrl-N - find a file/type, and try to open it.  Finds some types that the editor does not know how to open, like xsds and properties files.  You need to edit those types of files in some other editor.  Note that you will also need to restart the editor to take advantage of changes to properties files</li>
				<li> Ctrl-T - find the Type of the variable/expression that your cursor is on.  This one is great for figuring out what the coercion engine in Gosu is going to coerce your untyped variable into</li>
				<li> Ctrl-space - smart complete shows a popup for completing a partially typed expression, including:
				  <ul>
				  <li>partial variable names</li>
				  <li>property or method name</li>
				  <li>automatically adds a 'uses' statement for a type that hasn't been imported yet</li>
				  </ul>
				</li>
				<li> Alt-Enter - Smart fix.  This trys to fix the error nearest the cursor </li>
			  </ul>
			  Note that there are some cases where you need to drop extra java jar dependencies into your &lt;gosu_home&gt;/ext directory.  
		      <h1>Emacs</h1>
		      <div>For those of you still clinging to Emacs, here is a mode for you to do Gosu work with, provided by those of us still clinging to Emacs.</div>
		      <h2>Gosu Mode For Emacs:</h2>
		      <ul>
		        <li><a href="downloads/gosu-mode.el">gosu-mode.el</a></li>
		      </ul>

	   <h1>Eclipse</h1>
	   <div>The original release of Gosu (0.7.0-C) also had an Eclipse plugin that provided some of the IDE features that we wanted to provide.  We have since moved most of our efforts over to the IJ editor.  We do have plans to re-release the eclipse editor at some point.  If you are interested in helping, please contact us.</div>
	   
	   <h2>You can still download the old version of the <a href="eclipse.shtml">Eclipse plugin </a>
	   
	   <h1>Others</h1>
      <div>If you use another editor, and you've created a syntax definition file, let us know about it, and we'll link to it here.</div>
