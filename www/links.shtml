			<div class="linkDescription">The Dynamic Code Evolution Virtual Machine (DCE VM) is a modified version of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine (VM). The DCE VM supports any redefinition of loaded classes at runtime. You can add and remove fields and methods and make changes to the super types of a class using the DCE VM. The DCE VM is an improvement to the HotSpot VM, which only supports updates to method bodies.
We recommend the use of the DCE VM for development against a running server. </div>
